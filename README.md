`/meme everywhere "memes." "memes everywhere"`

For more information like available memes or command syntax type `/meme ` and press enter.

## Installation

From Mattermost 5.16 and later, the Memes Plugin is included in the Plugin Marketplace which can be accessed from **Main Menu > Plugins Marketplace**. You can install the Memes plugin there.

In Mattermost 5.15 and earlier, follow these steps:

1. Go to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-memes/releases/latest to download the latest release file in zip or tar.gz format.
2. Upload the file through **System Console > Plugins > Management**. See [documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/plugins.html#set-up-guide) for more details.

## Development

Read our documentation about the [Developer Workflow](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/developer-workflow/) and [Developer Setup](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/developer-setup/) for more information about developing and extending plugins.

Run `make memelibrary` to bundle up the meme assets (images, fonts, etc.).

For convenience, you can run the plugin from your terminal to preview an image for a given input. For example, on macOS, you can run the following to generate the above meme and open it in Preview:

`go run server/plugin.go -out demo.jpg 'memes. memes everywhere' && open demo.jpg`

This is especially useful when adding or modifying memes as you can quickly modify assets, `make memelibrary`, and preview the result using the above command. (See the files in ` memelibrary/assets` to get started with that.)
