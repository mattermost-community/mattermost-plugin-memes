This plugin will create a slash command that you can use to create memes!

`/meme everywhere "memes." "memes everywhere"`

For more information like available memes or command syntax type `/meme ` and press enter.

## Installation

1. Go to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-memes/releases/latest to download the latest release file in zip or tar.gz format.
2. Upload the file through **System Console > Plugins > Management**. See [documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/plugins.html#set-up-guide) for more details.

## Development

This plugin contains a server portion only. Read our documentation about the [Developer Workflow](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/plugins/developer-workflow/) and [Developer Setup](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/plugins/developer-setup/) for more information about developing and extending plugins.

Run `make memelibrary` to bundle up the meme assets (images, fonts, etc.).

For convenience, you can run the plugin from your terminal to preview an image for a given input. For example, on macOS, you can run the following to generate the above meme and open it in Preview:

`go run server/plugin.go -out demo.jpg 'memes. memes everywhere' && open demo.jpg`

This is especially useful when adding or modifying memes as you can quickly modify assets, `make memelibrary`, and preview the result using the above command. (See the files in ` memelibrary/assets` to get started with that.)

### Releasing new versions

The version of a plugin is determined at compile time, automatically populating a `version` field in the [plugin manifest](plugin.json):
* If the current commit matches a tag, the version will match after stripping any leading `v`, e.g. `1.3.1`.
* Otherwise, the version will combine the nearest tag with `git rev-parse --short HEAD`, e.g. `1.3.1+d06e53e1`.
* If there is no version tag, an empty version will be combined with the short hash, e.g. `0.0.0+76081421`.

To disable this behaviour, manually populate and maintain the `version` field.
